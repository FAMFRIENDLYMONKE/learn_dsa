# Learn DSA Resources

Compiled the resources ive been using to practise dsa.<br>
p.s. this is compiled wrt to serious competetive programming.

## How to Use

* **Goes From Begginer To Advanced**  <br>
* Practise the concept until you feel you have a grasp on it.
* Some concepts are underlined which are much more important than others
* ***REMEMBER*** its better to understand select good algorithms than haphazardly following the metagame
* Copetetive Programming is completely optional do not do it if you arent having fun or you dont understand it. Do not waste your life doing something as useless as this.
* Companies dont need your problem solving skills they care if you can center a _div_ or not.
* Questions are not repeated for concepts like linked lists. anything that can be done on a array can be done on a linked list, string, vector, etc etc

## General Introduction

![flowchart](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220520182504/ClassificationofDataStructure-660x347.jpg)

Every other data structure that you will probably learn about is either a part of these data structures or a Permutation and Combination of these.<br>Eg: Heap is a modified tree.


![algorithms](https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/types_of_algorithms-f.png)
Unfortunately Algorithms are quite many are generally take a lot of time to master. <br>Eg: Dynamic Programming questions can be quite the headache
## Resources

For the introductory Data structures I highly recommend the 5th Lecture on Cs50x 
**[CS50x][CS50xlec5]**

I Recommended Getting into Object Oriented Design Immediately after this using a language like C++, Python or JAVA<br>
I **Recommend** <br>
[Bjarne Soustroup's Book: Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++][book] <br>
(thanking [Weixiang Chen](https://github.com/chenweixiang) as i linked the book from his github page) <br>
for concepts on classes, constructors and objects.

Attempt to rewrite your DS in OOP form.<br>

Before going into Algorithms. We need to harness one more obstacle [Generic Programming]. To conquer this we shall set sail to the holy land called STL(Standard Template Libraries).<br>
**[Holy Grail of STL][hg1]**
